RESTGears aims to be:
- a simple to use and yet powerful document-based restful backend
- optimized for scalable environemtn like ep.io and google app engine
- compatible with RESTKit (http://restkit.org/)

RESTGears consists of:
- the document model (http://couchdb.apache.org/docs/intro.html)
- tagging and hierarchical categories
- file handling

A basic RESTGears insallation is similar to a very limited CouchDB (http://couchdb.apache.org/docs/intro.html) except that it runs on Google App Engine :-)
